I am a software engineer developing software and collaborative working environments. I am currently using functional programming (Scala) and DevOps culture approach. I know and use several programming languages.  I currently work at <a href="https://wearerealitygames.com/">Reality Games</a>, where we are building games based on big data. 

This is a blog about software engineering. I write about technical and organisational problems and try to come up with solutions based on experiments and research.

I welcome all the feedback, especially constructive one. Please contact me through [the contact page](/contact) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/miciek). See my [Github](https://github.com/miciek) to see what I am currently up to.
