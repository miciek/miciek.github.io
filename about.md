I am a polyglot software engineer specialised in developing distributed applications. Also a tea drinker, cyclist & functional programming enthusiast. I love the human component in software projects. I currently work as team leader at <a href="https://wearerealitygames.com/">Reality Games</a>, where we are building games based on big data.

This is a blog about programming and stuff related to programming and managing software projects. I write mostly to remember things better, but also to share things that fascinate me.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/miciek), if you want to know what stuff will get here in the near future. See my [Github](https://github.com/miciek) to see what I am currently up to.
