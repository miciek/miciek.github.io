I am a software engineer developing maintainable software & collaborative working environments. I speak at conferences, run workshops & organise meetups to help others make better products. I enjoy teaching and learning about different _teachning methods_. I wrote a book about functional programming for beginners: ["Grokking Functional Programming"](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-functional-programming?utm_source=michal&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_khan_grokking_6_26_19&a_aid=michal&a_bid=7c041142). 

This blog is about software engineering. I write about technical and organisational problems and try to come up with solutions based on experiments and research.

I welcome all the feedback, especially a constructive one. Please contact me through [the contact page](/contact) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/miciek). See my [Github](https://github.com/miciek) to see what I am currently up to.
