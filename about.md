This is a blog about programming and stuff that we do in order to make software projects happen. I write mostly to remember things better, but also to share things that fascinate me.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/miciek), if you want to know what stuff will get here in the near future. See my [Github](https://github.com/miciek) to see what I am currently up to.
