Today is the last day of the year and I'd like to compile a very short list of best 4 functional Scala talks I've seen during the last 365 days. If you missed any of them, now is the best time to catch up!

## Having a cake and eating it too (Introduction to Typeclasses)
An intense 30-minute introduction to typeclasses based on a very practical example. You meet Jimmy and see how he behaves during the worst possible day for any software developer - *The Day When StackOverflow Is Down*. Given at [Scalar Conf 2016](http://scalar-conf.com/) by [Pawe≈Ç Szulc](http://www.rabbitonweb.com/).

## The Dialectics of Type-Level Programming
If you want to know how to make the compiler typecheck your HTTP API, you should definitely watch this talk! [Aaron Levin](http://aaronlevin.ca/) takes us on a journey through Shapeless and Haskell Servant inspired ideas. This will give you a nice foundation for understanding many more generic programming concepts. Given at [Lambda World 2016](http://www.lambda.world/).

## Establishing Orbit with Shapeless
Beginner-level introduction to both "Why?" and "How?" of Shapeless and generic programming. [Dave Gurnell](http://davegurnell.com/) presents a very simple and easy-to-follow CSV file example. If you've never programmed using Shapeless and you don't know what all the fuss is about, make sure you watch this! Given at [Scala eXchange 2016](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7432-scala-exchange-2016#program).

## Pure Functional Database Programming with Fixpoint Types
This is a more involved presentation about some category theory concepts based on real world example. [Rob Norris](http://tpolecat.github.io/about.html) introduces Fixpoint Types by using his implementation of `Fix` and `Cofree` to insert and query a very simple data type. He shows how to use both types in database programming based on [doobie](https://github.com/tpolecat/doobie) - pure functional JDBC layer for Scala. Doobie is also a nice example of using `Free` monad. Given at [Scala World 2016](https://scala.world/).

## What do you think?
I try to watch as many talks as possible, but it's still possible I missed something excellent. Please let me know in the comments section below or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/miciek) if that's the case.
