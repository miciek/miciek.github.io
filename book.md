title: Grokking Functional Programming
permalink: /book/
---

I have written a book that teaches practical functional programming starting with basic fundamental topics and ending with concurrent programs that use streaming concepts and lots of I/O: ["Grokking Functional Programming"](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-functional-programming?utm_source=michal&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_khan_grokking_6_26_19&a_aid=michal&a_bid=7c041142).

## Code repository
The book comes with a self-sustaining code repository. Go ahead and check it out on GitHub: [https://github.com/miciek/grokkingfp-examples](https://github.com/miciek/grokkingfp-examples).

Note: the book is still in production. Both this page and the `README.md` in the code repository will be expanded before the book hits the shelves.
